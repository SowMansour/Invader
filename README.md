## What is the goal of the Arcade project :thinking:

:space_invader: Designing a JavaScript application to create a pixel art drawing board in the style of the famous game Space Invaders. :space_invader:

In this project, the goal is to develop a JavaScript application that allows users to create pixel art drawings resembling the iconic Space Invaders game. The concept involves building a virtual canvas where each pixel represents a small unit of the overall picture. By selecting different colors and placing pixels on the canvas, users can create intricate designs reminiscent of the classic arcade game.

The application will provide a user-friendly interface with a range of tools, including color palettes, brushes, and an eraser. Users will be able to select colors from the palette and apply them to individual pixels on the canvas, allowing for precise design. The drawing process will be interactive and intuitive, enabling users to see their creation taking shape as they add each pixel.

This project not only showcases the technical skills required for JavaScript programming but also highlights the creativity involved in designing and implementing a fun and nostalgic pixel art tool :bulb:

By combining the concepts of game aesthetics and interactive design, this project aims to bring the charm of Space Invaders into a new context, allowing users to experience the joy of pixel art creation while paying homage to a legendary arcade game."
